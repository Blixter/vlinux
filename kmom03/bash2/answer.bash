# ==========================================================================
# Lab 2 - vlinux 
# 
# A lab where you use Unix tools available from the command line interface
# together with a little Bash, to find and handle information in a [IRC
# loggfil](ircLog.txt).
#

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Section 1. Bash 
# 
# Train Linux commands and use them together with Bash.
#
# I this exercise you will mainly use comands like `grep`, `wc`, `head` and
# `tail` to search for information in a log file from the irc-chat.
#
# Then you combine the output of the commands to variables in Bash. Use the
# man-pages when needed to find information on how to solve the exercises.
#

# Exercise 1.1 (1 points)
